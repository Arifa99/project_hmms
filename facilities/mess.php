    <p style="text-align: justify">The mess in our hall is for residence of the sarojini naidu hall. Mess Secretary is selected by general election among the residents of hall to have a overall look into mess related matters. Food incharge forms a committee of 10 members called as Mess Committee for proper functioning and day to day activities of the mess. Resident warden is a default member of this committee. </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify">The menu of the items is prepared by mess committee and approved by resident warden. This menu is revised periodically with feedback from residents. Along with the vegetarian food, non-vegetarian food items like chicken and mutton on alternate days are also served. For people who are suffering from any health disorders, sick diet is served to them on request. There is a provision for the guests/relatives for taking the food in the hall mess on either cash coupon or entering the details in hall resident account.</p>
